## UE18CS303 Challenge Set - 1/4

Hi Guys ,

As I had told you this was on my bucket list and before I get booted out of my home office I am quickly doing a few more posts on what I had committed in class.

UE18CS303 Helicopter Challenge:

This challenge is open to all UE18CS303 students only. You can gang up without any restrictons on the size of your team as long as they are PES UE18CS303 students.

You can get help from any resources seniors/faculty of PES as well at an informal level. I would defintely help you out should you require help in these challenges.

Date of Final  Submission of this part 1 of the challenge: 19-Sep-2020. I will announce the logistics of submission.

You can use open source stuff as long as you acknowledge stuff and have the authors permission.

Guidelines:

1. All logical components must be developed in Python 3.7+ .

2. Each of your UI components must be exposed thru REST API. This is fairly simple if you use flask and decorator pattern

3. Ever UI element must have the following - PES Logo at the top right corner - sample interface shortly

4. The corporate color scheme of PES is what you would use in UI.

5. For visualizations - thats your choice - my recommendation is try and blend it around corporate colors.

6. Do your own imports. Dont assume something to be available but do it once if the library is not already present in the environment

PLEASE LOOK AT THE OPEN SOURCE TOOL WEKA FOR the general LOOK and FEEL. This is a desktop app , what we want is an web application

Requirements:

1. Data that is used for a particular challenge must be importable thru a csv file for all algorithms . You could specify the structure of data import file as an example.

2. Any well known data set - your choice that is good for illustration must be provided along with each challenge and an UI element called "TRY and EXAMPLE" would load this data.

3. Step thru of the algorithm that you code up must be provided with the relevant pseudo code displayed. Example as we make decision trees. Choice of attributes, Entropy, Average Information Entropy and IG must be shown with a small time leg ( you can provide a pause if you wish ) so that the user understands the process.

4. Visual constructions where possible at relevant steps is absolutely essential ex. how margins get formed in SVM or the tree getting constructed.

(3blue1brown does great visualizations and so does Jay Alammar)

5.All elements must be exposed as REST API , while you could provide test stubs in python for CLI. The entire set would finally be hosted and the entry point assume http://UExxCS303....... would have all your algorithms called out using REST APIs for our students and faculty who wish to explore MI.

Whats is in for me:

1. You contribution to your fellow students, juniors , faculty a learning tool that would be acknowledged by the College

2. Bonus points in your grading in your current course.  This is a top up to the assignments 

3. Goodies - Surprise !!!

5. Convert these into research papers.

(so whats 4. ???)

So what are the 1/4 challenge

1. Decision tree algorithm that can do classification and regression built ground up  for discrete and continuous values.

2. Neural Backed Decision Trees - explaining the decisions of a neural network implementation of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00221.pdf paper that helps you in explainable AI. Specific data sets such as that are visual highly recommended - choice is your. No need to implement it for temporal data.

3. SVM - hard and soft margins with SVR and multi-class classification ( this is tough)

4. Uninformed and Informed Search specifically ( DFS/BFS/UCS/GBFS/A*) implementation - choice of heuristics must be provided 

All code developed must be developed as open source and must be pushed to git hub . I will provide the git hub for the final post.

Panel : 3 TAs, Prof Rama, 2 students from your group that you wish to nominate and Prof Srini. 

Should you need any further help on this feel free to reach out to me  via mail/call. Dont post here.

p.s if you have these ready please do submit earlier.  We can do hangout calls for review/help.

Regards

Srini
